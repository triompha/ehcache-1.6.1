Preface

    This is a book about ehcache, a widely used open source Java cache. Ehcache has grown in size and scope since it
    was introduced in October 2003. As people used it they often noticed it was missing a feature they wanted. Over time,
    the features that were repeatedly asked for, and make sense for a Cache, have been added.

    Ehcache is now used for Hibernate caching, data access object caching, security credential caching, web caching,
    SOAP and RESTful server caching, application persistence and distributed caching. 

* Version

   This book is for Ehcache version 1.5.


* Audience

    The intended audience for this book is developers who use ehcache. It should be able to be used to start from scratch,
     get up and running quickly, and also be useful for the more complex options.

    Ehcache is about performance and load reduction of underlying resources. Another natural audience is performance specialists.

    It is also intended for application and enterprise architects. Some of the features of ehcache, such as
    distributed caching and Java EE caching, are alternatives to be considered along with other ways of solving those problems.
    This book discusses the trade-offs in ehcache's approach to help make a decision about appropriateness of use.


* Acknowledgements

    Ehcache has had many contributions in the form of forum discussions, feature requests, bug reports, patches and code commits.

    Rather than try and list the many hundreds of people who have contributed to ehcache in some way it is better to link
    to the web site where contributions are acknowledged in the following ways:

    * Bug reports and features requests appear in the changes report here: {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html}}}

    * Patch contributors generally end up with an author tag in the source they contributed to

    * Team members appear on the team list page here: {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/team-list.html}}}

    Thanks to Denis Orlov for suggesting the need for a book in the first place.


* {About the ehcache name and logo}

[images/ehcache_logo]

    {Adam Murdoch} (an all round top Java coder) came up with the name in a moment of inspiration while we were stuck on the
    SourceForge project create page. Ehcache is a palindrome. He thought the name was wicked cool and we agreed.

     The logo is similarly symmetrical, and is evocative of the diagram symbol
    for a doubly-linked list. That structure lies at the heart of ehcache.
