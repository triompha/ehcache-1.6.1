{Cache Extensions}

    CacheExtensions are a general purpose mechanism to allow {generic extensions to a Cache}.

    CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle. For that reason this interface has the lifecycle
    methods.

    CacheExtensions are created using the CacheExtensionFactory which has a <code>createCacheCacheExtension()</code> method which takes as a parameter a
    Cache and properties. It can thus call back into any public method on Cache, including, of
    course, the load methods.

    CacheExtensions are suitable for timing services, where you want to create a timer to perform
    cache operations. The other way of adding Cache behaviour is to decorate a cache.

    See {@link net.sf.ehcache.constructs.blocking.BlockingCache} for an example of how to do this.

    Because a CacheExtension holds a reference to a Cache, the CacheExtension can do things such as registering a CacheEventListener
    or even a CacheManagerEventListener, all from within a CacheExtension, creating more opportunities for customisation.


*   Declarative Configuration

    Cache extension are configured per cache. Each cache can have zero or more.

    A CacheExtension is configured by adding a cacheExceptionHandlerFactory element as shown in the following example:

------------------------------------------

<cache ...>
     <cacheExtensionFactory class="com.example.FileWatchingCacheRefresherExtensionFactory"
         properties="refreshIntervalMillis=18000, loaderTimeout=3000,
                     flushPeriod=whatever, someOtherProperty=someValue ..."/>

</cache>

------------------------------------------


* Implementing a {CacheExtensionFactory} and CacheExtension

    CacheExtensionFactory is an abstract factory for creating
    cache extension. Implementers should provide their own concrete
    factory, extending this abstract factory. It can then be configured in
    ehcache.xml

    The factory class needs to be a concrete subclass of the abstract
    factory class CacheExtensionFactory, which is reproduced below:

------------------------------------------
/**
 * An abstract factory for creating <code>CacheExtension</code>s. Implementers should
 * provide their own * concrete factory extending this factory. It can then be configured
 * in ehcache.xml.

 * @version $Id: cache_extensions.apt 735 2008-08-10 23:51:48Z gregluck $
 */
public abstract class CacheExtensionFactory {

    /**
     * @param cache the cache this extension should hold a reference to, and to whose
     * lifecycle it should be bound.
     * @param properties implementation specific properties configured as delimiter separated
     * name value pairs in ehcache.xml
     */
    public abstract CacheExtension createCacheExtension(Ehcache cache, Properties properties);

}

------------------------------------------

    The factory creates a concrete implementation of the CacheExtension
    interface, which is reproduced below:

/**

 * <p/>
 * CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle. For that reason this interface has the

    /**
     * @return the status of the extension

}

    The implementations need to be placed in the classpath accessible to ehcache.

    See the chapter on {{{./class_loading.html}Classloading}} for details on how classloading
    of these classes will be done.


*   Programmatic Configuration

    Cache Extensions may also be programmatically added to a Cache as shown.

---
    TestCacheExtension testCacheExtension = new TestCacheExtension(cache, ...);
    testCacheExtension.init();
    cache.registerCacheExtension(testCacheExtension);
