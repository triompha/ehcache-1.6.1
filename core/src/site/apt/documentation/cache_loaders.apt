{Cache Loaders}

   A <<<CacheLoader>>> is an interface which specifies <<<load>>> and <<<loadAll>>> methods with a variety of parameters.

   CacheLoaders come from JCache, but are a frequently requested feature, so they have been incorporated into the core
    Ehcache classes and can be configured in ehcache.xml.

   CacheLoaders are invoked in the following Cache methods:

     * getWithLoader (synchronous)

     * getAllWithLoader (synchronous)

     * load (asynchronous)

     * loadAll (asynchronous)

   They are also invoked in similar (though slightly differently named) JCache methods.

   The methods will invoke a CacheLoader if there is no entry for the key or keys requested. By implementing CacheLoader,
    an application form of loading can take place. The get... methods follow the pull-through cache pattern.
    The load... methods are useful as cache warmers.

   CacheLoaders are similar to the CacheEntryFactory used in SelfPopulatingCache. However SelfPopulatingCache is a decorator
     to ehcache. The CacheLoader functionality is available right in a Cache, Ehcache or JCache and follows a more industry
      standard convention.

    CacheLoaders may be set either declaratively in the ehcache.xml configuration file or programmatically. This becomes the
    default CacheLoader. Some of the methods invoking loaders enable an override CacheLoader to be passed in as a parameter. 

    More than one cacheLoader can be registered, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed
     in order. If a loader returns null, the next in chain is called.


*   Declarative Configuration

    cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache. More than one cacheLoaderFactory element
      can be added, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed in order. If a
      loader returns null, the next in chain is called.

------------------------------------------

<cache ...>
      <cacheLoaderFactory class="com.example.ExampleCacheLoaderFactory"
                                      properties="type=int,startCounter=10"/>
</cache>

* Implementing a {CacheLoaderFactory} and CacheLoader

    CacheLoaderFactory is an abstract factory for creating CacheLoaders. Implementers should
     provide their own concrete factory, extending this abstract factory. It can then be configured in
    ehcache.xml

    The factory class needs to be a concrete subclass of the abstract
    factory class CacheLoaderFactory, which is reproduced below:

------------------------------------------
/**
 * An abstract factory for creating cache loaders. Implementers should provide their own
 * concrete factory extending this factory.
 * <p/>
 * There is one factory method for JSR107 Cache Loaders and one for Ehcache ones. The Ehcache
 * loader is a sub interface of the JSR107 Cache Loader.
 * <p/>
 * Note that both the JCache and Ehcache APIs also allow the CacheLoader to be set
 * programmatically.

public abstract class CacheLoaderFactory {

    /**
     * Creates a CacheLoader using the JSR107 creational mechanism.
     * This method is called from {@link net.sf.ehcache.jcache.JCacheFactory}
     *
     * @param environment the same environment passed into

     * the associated cache is created.
     *
     * @param properties implementation specific properties. These are configured as comma
     *                   separated name value pairs in ehcache.xml

    public abstract net.sf.ehcache.loader.CacheLoader createCacheLoader(Properties properties);

     *  separated name value pairs in ehcache.xml
     * @return a constructed CacheLoader
     */
    public abstract CacheLoader createCacheLoader(Ehcache cache, Properties properties);

}
------------------------------------------

    The factory creates a concrete implementation of the CacheLoader
    interface, which is reproduced below.

    A CacheLoader is bound to the lifecycle of a cache, so that <<<init()>>> is called
    during cache initialization, and <<<dispose()>>> is called on disposal of a cache.

    of these classes will be done.

    of loaders:

     *
     * @param cacheLoader A Cache Loader to unregister
     */

     */
    public List<CacheLoader> getRegisteredCacheLoaders() {
        return registeredCacheLoaders;
