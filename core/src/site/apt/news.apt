* 14 July: Ehcache-OpenJPA 0.1 released

    An Ehcache plugin for OpenJPA has been released. It can be easily plugged in to OpenJPA  to provide familiar ehcache
    caching. Conceptually the plugin is similar to Hibernate. Persistent Object caches and Query caches are implemented.

    Download {{{/download.html}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/openjpa_provider.html}here}}.

    The release is also available on Maven central.

    Thanks to Craig Andrews for contributing this plugin.


* 17 June 2009: Ehcache 1.6.0 released

  This production release of ehcache-1.6 adds bug fixes and massive performance improvements. This release contains
  the changes mooted in February.

  The changes made remove used of the <<<synchronized>>> keyword from CacheManager, Cache and MemoryStore. The speed
  improvements kick in with significant numbers of threads which is what happens in production.
  Single-threaded performance, which is what you will see in your IDE is unchanged.

  The improvements are:

  * Gets 60 times faster

  * Puts 10 times faster

  * Removes 50 times faster


  This version removes all dependencies. Finally It is compatible with Google App Engine.

  For those still wishing to use the old engine it can be turned on at runtime
  using <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.

  Download {{{/download.html}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.
  The release is also available on Maven central.

  There are no open bugs at time of release.

* 16 June 2009: Ehcache is now compatible with Google App Engine

   The shipping Ehcache-1.6.0 will be compatible with Google App Engine.

   The fixes are now in the {{{http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/sourceforge-snapshots/net/sf/ehcache/}snapshots}}.

   See the extensive {{{/documentation/googleappengine.html}Google App Engine HowTo}} for configuration, recipes and more.

* 12 June 2009: Ehcache 1.6.0-rc1 released

  The first release candidate of the ehcache-1.6, with its new higher performance engine. This version has benefited
  from production use of beta5. At date of release there are no open bugs.

  This release uses the sl4j logging facade. Plug in your own logger.

  For those wishing to use the old engine it can be turned on at runtime
  using <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.

  Download {{{/download.html}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.
  The release is also available on Maven central.

* 10 May 2009: Ehcache 1.6 core beta 5 released

  This beta release of ehcache-1.6 adds bug fixes and massive performance improvements. This release contains
  the changes mooted in February.

  The changes made remove used of the <<<synchronized>>> keyword from CacheManager, Cache and MemoryStore. The speed
  improvements kick in with significant numbers of threads which is what happens in production.
  Single-threaded performance, which is what you will see in your IDE is unchanged.

  The improvements are:

  * Gets 81 times faster

  * Puts 22 times faster

  * Removes 42 times faster

  The upshot of all this is that ehcache performance is now comparable with direct use of <<<java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap>>>

  See {{{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2009/02/i_have_been_wai.html}
     Greg Luck's Blog}} for some amazing charts generated with JBoss' cache performance testing tool.

  This version removes usage of

* 10 May 2009: New Ehcache Maven repo

  The primary ehcache repo has been migrated, with all history to {{http://oss.sonatype.org}}. This change simplifies
  deployment and provides an advanced Maven Repository Manager to ehcache users. As usual all release artifacts are
  deployed to the central Maven repository.
  See {{{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2009/05/anyone_with_a_p.html}Greg Luck's blog}} for the full details.

* 20 April 2009: Ehcache 1.6-beta4 withdrawn

   Ehcache 1.6-beta4 has been marked as inactive on SourceForge. In extensive testing last week a very rare
     concurrency issue was found in the new high-performance threading code. A specific test has been created
     which reliably reproduces the issue. Will re-release once this as fixed under beta5.

* 11 April 2009: Ehcache Server and Ehcache Web updates released

    Ehcache Server, Standalone Server and Ehcache Web have been released to Maven Central and Sourceforge Downloads.

    Ehcache Server adds per PUT ttls to its REST API. The Standalone Server is upgraded to build 14 of Glassfish V3 Prelude
    Embedded which fixes all outstanding feature requests raised against it by this project. See the updated
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/cache_server.html}documentation}}.

    Ehcache Web 1.6.0-beta2 contains a minor bug fix over beta1.

    This beta release of ehcache-1.6.0 adds bug fixes and dramatic performance improvements.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. All documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.

    A note on naming. With ehcache fully modularised, each module has its own release cycle which may or may not
    correspond with the Ehcache core releases.


* 7 April 2009: Ehcache 1.6.0-beta4 released

    This beta release of ehcache-1.6.0 adds bug fixes and dramatic performance improvements.

    Please DO NOT use this version in production. It is beta and contains significant changes to threading.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. All documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.


* 23 February 2009: Exciting News! Ehcache Core two orders of magnitude faster

  With all of the focus on new replication schemes and Cache Server, the core has been pretty stable for a while.
  The forthcoming 1.6.0-beta4 shows off Gets that are 92 times faster than Ehcache 1.5. See {{{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2009/02/i_have_been_wai.html}
     Greg Luck's Blog}} for some amazing charts.

* 28 January 2009: New releases which break JCache into its own module.

    A new release of Ehcache core, ehcache-1.6.0-beta3 and the new ehcache-jcache-1.1 break JCache functionality
    into its own Maven module and file download. jsr107cache has been updated to 1.1.

    The upshot of this change is that ehcache core has no third party dependencies, simplifying its use for many
    and making it easier to add ehcache to other projects.

    This completes the modularisation work for 1.6. The next beta will add bug fixes, performance improvements
    and some longstanding feature requests.

    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.


* 21 October 2008: ehcache-jgroupsreplication-0.1 released

    This is the second release of JGroups replication. This release moves it to its own module. It contains some performance
    improvements.

    JGroups Replication is it's own Maven module and downloadable distribution.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. The documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/distributed_caching_with_jgroups.html}here}}.

* 18 October 2008: Ehcache 1.6-beta1 released.

   The 1.6 release is a cleanup release which sets the foundation for future development.
   It updates the required Java version to 1.5, removes consequently redundant libraries and
   removes long deprecated methods. It also makes some fine tuning to the CacheLoader API.

   Finally, this release completes ehcache's long migration to a pure maven build. As part of that,
   JGRoups replication has been broken out into its own module.

   See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.5.0}changelog}} for complete details.

    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation//src/site/apt/documentation/}here}}.

* 18 October 2008: ehcache-jmsreplication 0.1 released

    This is the first release of JMS replication for ehcache. Thanks to Benoit Perroud for getting this going
    with a code contribution.

    It provides:

    * replication between cache nodes using a replication topic, in accordance with ehcache's standard replication mechanism

    * pushing of data directly to cache nodes from external topic publishers, in any language. This is done by sending
      the data to the replication topic, where it automatically picked up by the cache subscribers.

    * a JMSCacheLoader, which sends cache load requests to a queue. Either an ehcache cluster node, or an external
      queue receiver can respond.

   jmsreplication is it's own Maven module and downloadable distribution.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. The documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation//src/site/apt/documentation/distributed_caching_with_jms.html}here}}.

* 16 October 2008: ehcache-server 0.5 released

   This release of the SOAP and RESTful cache serverconsolidates minor changes and improvements based on feedback from
    users , since the 0.1 release. The release is packaged both as a WAR for dropping into your web container of choice,
     and as a ready to go server with Glassfish V3 embedded.

    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/cache_server.html}here}}.

* 18 August 2008: Ehcache 1.6 development underway

   Ehcache-1.6 development is underway.

   1.6 Goals:

   * Minimum Java version 1.5

   * minimise dependencies for core users: drop commons logging, commons collections and backport concurrent (already done in trunk and snapshot)

   * add a JMS distributed cache replicator

   * add RESTful ehcache server as secondary store, leveraging the new ehcache-server, and using partitioning (memcached feature)

   * introduce new performance strategies and secondary store categories to allow greater optimisation. The goal
   is to make ehcache faster than java.util.concurrent for in-process caching and as scalable as memcached for out-of-process
   caching.

   * group invalidation (OSCACHE feature)

   * add other oustanding feature requests

   Check trunk regularly for updates. For maven users (of which ehcache is one) a SNAPSOT repository has been added. See
    {{http://ehcache.sf.net/snapshotrepository}}


* 11 August 2008: Ehcache 1.5 Book released on Lulu.com

   The new edition of the {{{http://www.lulu.com/content/3553390}Ehcache Book}},  has been released on Lulu.com. In particular
   the book covers the new RESTful and SOAP Cache Server.

   It is available in downloadable PDF or print versions.

* 17 July 2008: ehcache-standalone-server 0.1 released

   The standalone server provides a ready to go cache server out of the box, using the WAR from the ehcache-server module. Unix-based
    and Windows servers are supported.

   Start it with <<<java -jar ../lib/ehcache-standalone-server-0.1.jar 8080 ../war>>>
   or the jsvc wrapper with <<<daemon.sh start>>>.

* 12 July 2008: ehcache-server-0.1 released

   This is the first version of an ehcache W3C Web Services server, packaged as a WAR. This version is made available for testing.
   See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/cache_server.html}documentation}}.

   Two APIs are supported: A soap API specified in {{{http://ehcache.sf.net/wsdl/EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService.wsdl}EhcacheWebServiceEndpointService.wsdl}}
   and a RESTful, resource oriented API. This release provides a feature-complete soap API. The RESTful API is not yet feature complete.

* 12 July 2008: ehcache-1.5.0 released

   Ehcache 1.5.0 provides a couple of fixes to changes made in beta1. If you are testing 1.5 please use this version.

** New Features

    * Added JGroups Implementation. Thanks to Pierre Monestie for the patch(es) for this. Though new to the
      core distribution JGroups replication has been in production use in a large cluster for the last year.
      JGroups has a "provided" scope. So, anyone wishing to use this form of replication will need to add
      it to their dependencies.

    * CachingFilter performance improvements

    * Constructs performance improvements

    * added loadAll() to the loader implementation to enable preload without specifying keys.

    * diskPersistent now can be used with caches that use only MemoryStore in normal use but want to persist to disk

    * DiskStores are now optional. The element is now non-mandatory. This will simplify configurations particularly
                where multiple CacheManagers are being used.
              If one or more caches requires a DiskStore, and none is configured, java.io.tmpdir will be used and
                a warning message will be logged to encourage explicity configuration of the diskStore path.

    * The default RMI based cache replication can now configure a RemoteObject port so that it can be easily configured
      to work through firewalls. This is done by adding a new property remoteListenerPort to RMICacheManagerPeerListenerFactory
                to enable it to be specified.

    * Added a new system property expansion token "ehcache.disk.store.dir" to DiskStore configuration which
      can be used to specify the DiskStore directory on the command line or in an environment variable.

---
    e.g. java -Dehcache.disk.store.dir=/u01/myapp/diskdir ...
---

    * Added the ability to specify system property tokens using ${tokenname} in ehcache.xml which are then
                replaced when the configuration is loaded.

    * Updated the remote debugger with enhanced reporting and better documentation (See Logging page in
      the documentation).

      The new version prints a list of caches with replication configured, prints notifications as they
      happen, and periodically prints the cache name, size and total events received.

      Note that the debugger is gaining more attention and is now distributed in its own tar ball. It has also moved to its own
      pure maven build and has additional testing.


**   Summary of Bug Fixes

    * CachingFilter bug fixes for various rare edge conditions

    * Major speed up to shutdown process when diskPersistent is not being used

    * Fixed various shutdown exception when both Hibernate and Spring both try to destroy caches


    See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.5.0}changelog}} for complete details.

* 7 June 2008: ehcache-1.5.0-beta2 release

   Ehcache 1.5.0-beta2 provides a couple of fixes to changes made in beta1. If you are testing 1.5 please use this version.

* 13 May 2008: ehcache-1.5.0-beta1 release

   Ehcache 1.5.0-beta1 provides a host of new features and a few bug fixes. (See the ehcache-1.5.0 final release news item).



* 1 March 2008: ehcache is SourceForge project of the month

   Ehcache has been honoured as the February 2008 SourceForge project of the month. See {{http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/potm-200802/}}.


* 21 February 2008: ehcache-1.4.1 maintenance release

    The version of ehcache is a minor maintenance release. The main reason for the release was to include ehcache-failsafe.xml
    which was omitted from the public maven repository version. See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.4.1}changelog}}
    for complete details.

* 31 January 2008: ehcache-1.4.0 released

    The final version of ehcache-1.4.0 is available on sourceforge and the Maven central repository.

    This version significantly enrichens the ehcache API and enhances extension of ehcache. The new features are:

    * You can now define CacheLoaders in the ehcache core API. They supplement the existing SelfPopulatingCache.
      They can be configured in ehcache.xml or programmatically. They can be used for cache warming, and simple pull-through
      caching. See the {{{/documentation/cache_loaders.html}Cache Loaders}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    * You can now define a CacheExceptionHandler and register it progammatically or in ehcache.xml.
      This enables an exception handler to be registered with a cache so that it is called on exception rather than the exception being thrown.
      See the {{{/documentation/cache_exception_handlers.html}Cache Exception Handler}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    * You can now define CacheExtensions and register them progammatically or in ehcache.xml. A CacheExtension is a generic facility which holds a reference
      to a cache and is bound to the cache lifecycle, making possible a wide variety of extensions to behaviour. Usage examples are
      a cache refresh timer or a file monitoring mechanism.
      See the {{{/documentation/cache_extensions.html}Cache Extensions}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    This final release follows the second beta release by a month and fixes a few minor issues. See
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.4.0}changelog}} for complete details.

    A new {{{http://stores.lulu.com/ehcache}Book}} has been released to coincide with ehcache-1.4.0.    

* 1 January 2008: ehcache-1.4-beta2 released

   The beta 2 version of ehcache-1.4 is available on sourceforge and the Maven central repository.

   The second beta release fixes 10 bugs, most of them in the new features being introduced in 1.4.0, reported
   by beta testers. See the
   {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.4.0-beta2}changelog}} for complete details.


* 30 November 2007: Ehcache book available

[images/ehcache_guide.gif] Ehcache Guide & Reference

 Ehcache Guide and Reference for the forthcoming 1.4.0 release is available as a book.
 The price for the high quality bound edition is USD49.95 plus shipping. The price for the downloadable print-ready version
 is USD37.50. The book has 154 pages.

 Many people have asked for a format for the documentation where it can be printed out as a book and even where they can get it.
 Of course, full documentation in html will always remain available online at http://ehcache.sf.net.

 Buy it from the {{{http://stores.lulu.com/ehcache}Ehcache Storefront}} at Lulu Books.


* 26 August 2007: ehcache-1.4-beta released

    The beta version of ehcache-1.4 is available on sourceforge and the Maven central repository.

    This version significantly enrichens the ehcache API and enhances extension of ehcache. The new features are:

    * You can now define CacheLoaders in the ehcache core API. They supplement the existing SelfPopulatingCache.
      They can be configured in ehcache.xml or programmatically. They can be used for cache warming, and simple pull-through
      caching. See the {{{/documentation/cache_loaders.html}Cache Loaders}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    * You can now define a CacheExceptionHandler and register it progammatically or in ehcache.xml.
      The enable an exception handler to be registered with a cache so that it is called on exception rather than the exception being thrown.
      See the {{{/documentation/cache_exception_handlers.html}Cache Exception Handler}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    * You can now define CacheExtensions and register them progammatically or in ehcache.xml. A CacheExtension is a generic facility which holds a reference
      to a cache and is bound to the cache lifecycle, making possible a wide variety of extensions to behaviour. Usage examples are
      a cache refresh timer or a file monitoring mechanism.
      See the {{{/documentation/cache_extensions.html}Cache Extensions}} chapter in the documentation for more details.

    There are 5 minor bug fixes in the release. At the time of release there are no open bugs in ehcache.

    See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.4.0-beta}changelog}} for complete details.

* 11 June 2007: ehcache-1.3 released

    The next major version of ehcache has been released.

    This version contains the following major new features over 1.2.4:

    * A draft JCache API (JSR107) package.

    * JMX instrumentation. Register a variety of MBeans from your  ehcache instance with your MBeanServer of choice.
      Care has been taken to make this implementation friendly to a wide variety of JMX NMSs.

    In terms of minor features:

    * A new cache attribute, diskSpoolBufferSizeMB, can be set to control the amount of memory that can be used
      for spooling to DiskStore

    * The ehcache shutdown hook is now off by default. Ehcache is typically used in scenarios where someone else
       has a shutdown hook. It can be re-enabled by setting <<<net.sf.ehcache.enableShutdownHook=true>>>

    The distributed caching feature of ehcache is now in wide-spread use in wide ranging environments. All of this field
    experience unearthed the need for further documentation, clarificationa and bug fixes, particularly for dirty
     or mis-configured networks, which have been provided in 1.3. Excellent performance has been reported for clusters with
     up to 20 nodes.

      A new {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/tomcat.html}Tomcat}} chapter in the documentation
      provides specific information on configuring Tomcat with ehcache.

    See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.3}changelog}} for complete details.

    Work on new features will now start on a new 1.4 branch. See the {{{roadmap.html}Roadmap}} for details. 1.3 will be maintained as
     the new stable branch.


* 27 May 2007: ehcache-1.3 beta 3 released

    This release fixes two bugs and has some minor changes to support third parties who are making extensions to ehcache. See
    See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.3-beta3}changelog}} for details.
    A final release should be out in the next few weeks.

* 22 May 2007: Ehcache Maven repository

    Ehcache has a Maven repository for releases at http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/repository. It is synchronized with the Maven central repository.
    New releases will now appear in the Maven repository without delay.

* 16 May 2007: JSR107 (JCACHE) News

    At JavaOne, Greg Luck, the maintainer of ehcache, was appointed as co Spec Lead of JSR107, JCACHE.

    The expert group has been reenergised and is making progress towards getting a spec done. Everyone is welcome to monitor technical discussion on
    JCACHE at the new mailing list - jsr107 AT jsr107.dev.java.net.

*  9 May 2007: JavaOne Talk

    TS-6175 - Distributed Caching, Using the JCACHE API and ehcache, Including a Case Study was attended by around 1200 people. About 50 people had
    question. There was so much interest that an impromptu Q&A session was held later that day. It appears that interest in caching and ehcache in
    particular remain very strong in the Java community.

* 4 May 2007: ehcache-1.3 beta 2 released

    Ehcache-1.3-beta2 has 7 fixes over beta 1. See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.3-beta2}changelog}} for details.

* 9 March 2007: ehcache-1.3 beta released

    New features in 1.3 are:

    * JCACHE implementation. This is a full implementation of JSR107.

    * JMX instrumentation. Register a variety of MBeans from your  ehcache instance with your MBeanServer of choice.
      Care has been taken to make this implementation friendly to a wide variety of JMX NMSs.

    In adding these new packages care has been taken not to disturb the existing packages. Only bug fixes have
    been applied to those. 8 bug fixes, representing all those reported since 1.2.4 have been fixed. Ehcache has no open bugs
    or patches at the time of release. See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.2.4}changelog}} for details.

* 22 February 2007: JavaOne Session.

    For anyone attending JavaOne 2007 at the Moscone Centre in San Francisco, the maintainer of ehcache, Greg Luck,
    will be presenting a session entitled "Distributed Caching, Using the JCACHE API and ehcache, Including a Case Study".
    This will be a practical session covering much of the recent features added to ehcache.


* 2 December 2006: ehcache-1.2.4 released

    This is a candidate for a maintenance release.

    It contains four feature and fifteen bug fixes received
    in the two months since ehcache-1.2.3 was released. See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.2.4}changelog}}
    for details.

    Eight of the changes in this release are scalability improvements contributed by users running very large ehcache
    deployments. The distributed caching changes stem from a user who is using ehcache in a multi-subnet cluster of 20 nodes.

    The Caching and Gzip filters in the web package have been updated to work on Glassfish and Tomcat.

    The distributed caching functionality in ehcache is now 6 months ago.

    The maintainer has now been running ehcache distributed in production for four months without incident.

    Ehcache has no open bugs or patches at the time of release.
 

* 2 September 2006: ehcache-1.2.3 released

    This is a maintenance release. It contains eight feature requests and 6 bug fixes received
    in the two months since ehcache-1.2.2 was released. See the {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1.2.3}changelog}}
    for details.

    All of the feature changes come from the suggestions of people with practical experience
    using ehcache-1.2. The changes are all fine tuning of the distributed caching
    functionality rather than large changes.

    The distributed caching functionality was released four months ago. There are many production
    sites running this now, including that of the maintainers.

    One of the more difficult aspects of getting distributed caching going is getting past network
    configurations that swallow multicast. A tool, ehcache-1.2.3-remote-debugger.jar is now included
    in the distribution so that distributed traffic can be listened in on.

    The number of lines of code in ehcache is now three times bigger than ehcache-1.0. They have increased
    as the features of ehcache have increased. To complement this increase in complexity, commercial support
    is now available for ehcache. Contact kluck@gregluck.com for details.

** 1 September 2006: Ehcache three years old and going strong

[images/downloads.gif]

    Ehcache had more than 4000 downloads per month for the last three months in a row. This is up
    from the 1500 downloads per month it was running at for the two years before then.

    The result is there is now a much larger user community who use ehcache directly, rather than
    through one of the popular frameworks. This places new demands on the project but also
    means that most of the code paths and API are being utilised, leading to fewer undiscovered bugs
    and a continuing evolution of features.

* 17 July 2006: ehcache-1.2.2 released

    This is a minor maintenance release to ehcache-1.2.1. It clears all bug reports and feature requests received
    since ehcache-1.2.1 was released. It also includes the fix in ehcache-1.2.0_02 to reduce memory consumption.

    See the {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=432513&group_id=93232}release notes and changelog for details}}.

* 16 July 2006: ehcache-1.2.0-02 released

    Contains a fix to quickly hand back memory when spooling to disk. See {{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2006/07/tuning_memory_u.html}}
    for details on the effect of this change.

* 3 July 2006: ehcache-1.2.1 released

    ehcache-1.2.1 is mostly a maintenance release of ehcache. It focuses on simplifying usage
    of new features and easing the migration path between ehcache-1.1 and ehcache-1.2. While
    ehcache-1.2 is backward compatible, some typical usage scenarios in Hibernate and Spring are
    not.

    See the separate news item on ehcache-1.2.1RC to get the full picture. Changes above ehcache-1.2.1RC are:

** Improvements

    * Change Blocking cache to use a lock striping technique for its Mutexes. This limits the number
    of Mutexes to 2048, rather than a number equalling the number of keys, while preserving excellent
    liveness and safety. Thanks to Olaf Krische for reporting this and Brian Goetz for assisting with
    a solution.


    * Change BlockingCache and SelfPopulatingCache to act as decorators for Ehcache. Remove now redundant
    BlockingCacheManager and SelfPopulatingCacheManager. Change signatures of these caches from Serializable
    to Object. This change is not backward compatible but no libraries use these, so developers can change
    over on their own projects.

** Bug fixes

    * Bug 1190614. This was reported by Victor Volle and is a duplicate of 1492900. Fixed.
    * Bug 1506399. Changing all classloading to the context classloader is sometimes inconvenient. Fallback to
    * ClassLoaderUtil.class.getClassLoader() if Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
    * fails. Thanks to Robert Watkins for reporting this one.
    * Bug 1508623. Debug messages generate excess String objects. Added logging level guards around about 6 debug log statements.
      Thanks to Derek Hulley for pointing this one out.
    * Harden all ehcache threads so that RuntimeExceptions and Errors do not stop them. This change, on its own, has been
      backported to a separate release, ehcache-1.2.0_01.

* 3 July 2006: ehcache-1.2.0-01 released

    Ehcache-1.2.0-01 is a backport of the thread hardening changes to the 1.2.0 branch. The 1.2.0 release will be
    supported with backports of other important fixes.

* 27 June 2006: ehcache maintainer added to JSR-107 expert group

    Greg Luck, the maintainer of ehcache, has been added to the JSR-107 expert group. The plan is to add a JSR-107
    compatibility API to ehcache. The benefit to users is that they can switch to and from ehcache with almost zero
    code cost, when using the JSR-107 API.

    Enabling changes to the ehcache codebase have been made in the ehcache-1.2.1 branch (released 3 July). Work on the
    compatibility API will occur in the 1.3 branch.

* 4 June 2006: ehcache-1.2.1RC {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}released}}.

    This is a release candidate for ehcache-1.2.1. There are a few very minor bug fixes in this release.
    The main focus is to resolve upgrade difficulties with client libraries which expect ehcache CacheManagers to be
    singletons as they were in ehcache-1.1. In ehcache-1.2 any attempt to have two CacheManagers sharing the same
    configuration resulted in a CacheException being thrown. The check was made on diskStorePath. In ehcache-1.2.1RC
    multiple CacheManagers sharing the same ehcache.xml configuration is permitted.

    To resolve conflicts with DiskStore paths, the second and subsequent CacheManagers create their data files in a
    unique subdirectory under the first CacheManager's diskStore path.

    The other potential conflict is in CacheManagerPeerListeners. In the default implementation the conflict is with RMI
    listener ports. To resolve this conflict the second and subsequent CacheManagers use a free port to listen on.

    For both, warning messages are logged encouraging clients to migrate over to their own ehcache.xml.

    There are also a number of enhancements/new features as follows:

    * New SingletonEhCacheProvider for use by Hibernate in situations where code has been written which relies on the
      singleton behaviour of ehcache-1.1 and earlier. Most code bases using Hibernate should not require this.

    * Allow cacheEventListenerFactory elements to be added to defaultCache in ehcache.xml. This allows caches created with
      CacheManager.a ddCache(String cacheName) to receive events. This can be used for example to set default replication
      settings in defaultCache.

    * To complement full support foe default cache (above), added support for programmatic addition of caches which
      include CacheReplicators. Also support for removal of these caches with CacheManager.remove(String cacheName).

    * Andy McNutt's JNDI-based manual RMI replication added. See ehcache.xml example for how to use.

    * Support tomcat 5.5 for the servlet filters. Tomcat integration testing, in addition to the Orion one,
      is also added to the full JUnit test process. Tomcat relies on Servlet 2.4 dispatcher INCLUDE and FORWARD directives
      for page fragment caching.

    * Support runtime setting of individual Element time to lives (TTLs), time to idles(TTIs) and eternal overrides.
      If an override is set, the Element expiry ignores the Cache default.

    * Add a cache bootstrap mechanism. This is used to populate a cache when it is first initialized. An abstract factory,
      BootstrapCacheLoaderFactory has been defined along with an interface BootstrapCacheLoader.
      The initial concrete implementations are for RMI, so that a new cache entering a cluster gets bootstrapped from a
      randomly chosen peer.

    Finally, the ehcache-constructs package has been merged into the ehcache module so that there is only one jar to
    download and install to get all functionaliy. Ehcache-constructs contains Java EE Caching filters and other useful
    applied caching solutions.

    See the {{{/changes-report.html}change log}} for more details.

    The plan is to rapidly release ehcache-1.2.1 within a week or so. Please report any issues with ehcache-1.2.1RC promptly.
    Documentation of the new features will be complete during this time.

* 3 June 2006: Printable PDF User Guide for ehcache available

  Some people have requested a printable manual for ehcache.
   Please see{{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/EhcacheUserGuide.pdf}EhcacheUserGuide.pdf}}


* 25 April 2006: {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}ehcache-1.2}} released.

     After 10 months of development, ehcache-1.2 is released. Thanks to all the developers who contributed to
      the release through feature requests, bug reports and patches during the beta program.

     The 1.2 release of ehcache has many new features including:

            * Flexible, extensible, high performance distributed caching. The default implementation supports cache
              discovery via multicast or manual configuration. Updates are delivered either asynchronously or synchronously
              via custom RMI connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be plugged in by third parties.

            * New FIFO and LFU caching policies in addition to the standard LRU.

            * Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener interfaces and default implementations.

            * Multiple CacheManagers per virtual machine.

            * Programmatic flushing of application state to persistent caches

            * Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases.

            * API for Objects in addition to Serializable. Non-serializable Objects can use all parts of ehcache
              except for DiskStore and replication. Two new methods on Element: getObjectValue and getKeyValue
              are the only API differences between the Serializable and Object APIs.

            * Backward Compatibility with ehcache-1.1. All users of ehcache-1.1 should be able to upgrade to ehcache-1.2.

            * Tested with Hibernate2.1.8 and  Hibernate3.1.3, which can utilise all of the new features except for Object API and
              multiple session factories each using a different ehcache CacheManager. A new <<<net.sf.ehcache.hibernate.EhCacheProvider>>>
              makes those additional features available to Hibernate-3.1.3. A version of the new provider should make it into
              the Hibernate3.2 release.

            * Tested with ehcache-constructs.

            * Apache 2.0 license

     At time of release, there are no open bugs against the ehcache-1.2. 21 bugs have been fixed in this release. Most
     of those were raised against the 1.2 beta releases.

     See the {{{/changes-report.html}changelog}} for more details on this release.

* 20 April 2006: Development Roadmap Updated

     The roadmap for new development has been updated {{{roadmap.html}here}}.

* 17 April 2006: ehcache-1.2rc1 released

     Released ehcache-1.2rc1 to give testers a chance to test recent fixes and fine tuning before a final release.

     At this point all bugs, support requests and feature requests are closed. Final testing is focusing on the
     distributed caching area.


* 8 April 2006: Elements are no longer required to be Serializable

     Following many requests, ehcache no longer requires that Elements contain Serializable keys and values. Ehcache
     will gracefully degrade for those operations which require Serialization.

     In particular the MemoryStore and event listeners can be used with Non Serializable elements.

     WARNING error messages are logged when an operation cannot be completed because the key or value is not Serializable.


* 28 March 2006: License changed from Apache 1.1 to Apache 2.0

     The ehcache 1.2 series from beta5 is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

* 26 March 2006: {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}1.2 beta 5 released}}.

     This is a bug fix release which fixes all reported issues in the new 1.2 features. Developers should be
     testing this version.

* 25 March 2006: Subversion

    Ehcache is now on Subversion. See the {{{/source-repository.html}source repository page}} for details.


* 17 March 2006: New Site Redesign

    Ehcache has outgrown its old web design. This new one is produced using {{{http://maven.apache.org}Maven 2}}.
    Please send any feedback on the new site to the {{{team-list.html}team}}.


* 14 March 2006: New Mailing List

    A new mailing list, ehcache-list@lists.sourceforge.net, has been created for ehcache users and developers. Go {{{mail-list.html}here}}
    to subscribe or to search the archive.


* 7 February 2006: Whats New in 1.2

     Ehcache-1.2, currently at beta 5, has many new features:

       * Introduced new caching policies in addition to the standard LRU.
     FIFO and LFU were added. LRU remains the default unless explicitly set
     in each cache's configuration. Thanks to Surya Suravarapu for working
     with me on these. The documentation has a new section on caching
     policies and when to use what.

       * Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener
     interfaces and default implementations. These can be configured in
     ehcache.xml or set programmatically. Thanks to steve at jofti dot com
     for help with the specification for these.

       * After requests from Jo Walnes, Paul Hammant and others, I have
     added normal instance constructers to CacheManager which do not act as
     singletons. The factory singleton methods remain for backward
     compatibility. CacheManager can now be constructed with a Configuration
     object programmatically.

       * Since version 1.1, ehcache has had a persistent diskStore, which
     makes it suitable for storing application state. Added a flush method
     so that, if the cache is diskPersistent, it can be programmatically
     flushed, in addition to the automatic flush which happens at shutdown.

       * Pluggable Distributed Caching. The default implementation
     supports cache discovery via multicast or manual configuration. Updates
     are delivered asynchronously or synchronously via custom RMI
     connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be plugged in
     by third parties.

       * Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases, after
     introduction of finer grained threading. Thanks to Robert Watkins for
     reporting on the performance limits.


       * Backward Compatibility

     Ehcache-1.2 is mostly backward compatible with ehcache-1.1. Ehcache-1.1 ehcache.xml configurations are compatible.
     There have been a few small API changes to the ehcache-1.1 API.

     See the {{{/changes-report.html}changelog}} for more details on the release.


* 8 February 2006 Announcing {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=392051&amp;group_id=93232}ehcache-1.2beta4}}.

 This fixes most reported bugs and has fairly complete documentation.

* 27 January 2006 Announcing {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=388617&amp;group_id=93232}ehcache-1.2 beta 3}}.

 New features over beta2 are:

  * Pluggable Distributed Caching. The default implementation
supports cache discovery via multicast or manual configuration. Updates
are delivered asynchronously or synchronously via custom RMI
connections. Additional discovery or delivery schemes can be plugged in
by third parties.

  * After requests from Jo Walnes, Paul Hammant and others, I have
added normal instance constructers to CacheManager which do not act as
singletons. The factory singleton methods remain for backward
compatibility. CacheManager can now be constructed with a Configuration
object programmatically.

  * Significant (up to 7 fold) DiskStore performance increases, after
introduction of finer grained threading. Thanks to Robert Watkins for
reporting on the performance limits.

 This release also contains 5 bug fixes and increased test coverage.
This version has been comprehensively tested, but has limited
production use.

 This will be the last pre release of ehcache-1.2 which adds major features. The focus will now
shift to addressing any bugs or issues raised by those using this
version. Basic documentation of the new features has been completed.
Work will also continue on providing&nbsp; configuration and coding
examples to use&nbsp; em.&nbsp; Please promptly report any bugs found.

* 16 October 2005 Announcing {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=363732}ehcache-1.2 beta 2}}.

 New features over beta1 are:

  * Introduced CacheManagerEventListener and CacheEventListener
interfaces and default implementations. These can be configured in
ehcache.xml or set programmatically. Thanks to steve at jofti dot com
for help with the specification for these.

  * Added normal instance constructers to CacheManager
which do not act as singletons. The factory singleton methods remain
for backward compatibility. CacheManager can now be
constructed with a Configuration object programmatically.

  * ehcache has a persistent diskStore, which makes it suitable for storing application state.
Added a flush method so that, if the cache is diskPersistent, it can be
programmatically flushed, in addition to the automatic flush which happens at shutdown.

 This release also contains 5 bug fixes and increased test coverage.

 This version has been comprehensively tested, but has limited production use.
It is recommended for development usage and testing.

* 28 August 2005 Announcing ehcache-1.2 beta 1.

 New in this version are two new cache eviction policies: Less
Frequently Used (LFU) and First In First Out (FIFO). There are also a
few minor bug fixes. Thanks to Surya Suravarapu for work on these new
policies.

 This version of ehcache should be backwardly compatible with
ehcache 1.1 except for a dependency on commons-collections 3.1, up from
version 2.1. This version has been comprehensively tested, but has
limited production use. It is recommended for development usage only.

* 15 August 2005 Announcing {{{/ehcache-constructs/index.html}ehcache-constructs-0.6}}.

 A subproject of ehcache, ehcache-constructs builds on top of ehcache to create implementations for common caching patterns. All implementations use
ehcache as the backing cache. They also share a common purpose - to create very high performance Java applications. New
in this version is a fault-tolerant AsynchronousCommandExecutor, which
will asynchronously execute arbitrary commands, optionally retrying on
a defined array of Exception types a defined number of times at a
defined interval.

* 23 November 2004 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=271146} ehcache 1.1}} released.

 This version splits out the constructs package into a separate sub-project. This simplifies ehcache
for those using it in Hibernate or directly. It also moves the constructs to a
separate jar and release cycle. There is only 1 minor bug fix but then
there was only one bug reported.

 See the release notes and full changelog {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=284863}here}}.

* 23 November 2004 Announcing {{{ehcache-constructs/index.html}ehcache-constructs-0.5}}

 A subproject of ehcache, ehcache-constructs builds on top of ehcache to create implementations for common caching patterns.
All implementations use ehcache as the backing cache. They also share a common purpose - to create very high performance Java applications.

 At present ehcache-constructs contains:

 * General Purpose Caching

  * BlockingCache - a cache which blocks subsequent threads until the first read thread populates a cache entry
  * SelfPopulatingCache - a read-through cache. A cache that populates elements as they are requested without requiring the caller
to know how the entries are populated. It also enables refreshes of cache entries without blocking reads on the same entries.

  * UpdatingSelfPopulatingCache - a read-through cache. A cache that
populates elements as they are requested without requiring the caller
to know how the entries are populated. The cache entry is automatically
updated on subsequent reads.

  * SelfPopulatingCollectionsCache - a SelfPopulatingCache that adds
threading safety where it is known in advance that all entries will be
collections.

 * Web Caching

   Servlet 2.3 caching filters that cache HTTP/S responses:

  * CachingFilter - an abstract, extensible caching filter.

  * SimplePageCachingFilter - a concrete implementation which caches
pages based on the request URI and Query String.

  * SimplePageFragmentCachingFilter - a concrete implementation which
caches page fragments based on the request URI and Query String.

 See the {{{ehcache-constructs/index.html}ehcache-constructs}} subsite for and overview, documentation, javadoc, clover test coverage and more.

* 28 September 2004 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=271146} ehcache 1.0 released}}.

 This is a major milestone for ehcache - the 1.0 release. It has several bug fixes and a few important new
features. They are:

  * Added SelfPopulatingCacheManager to the constructs package.

  * Added a new diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds configuration option to ehcache.xml,
to allow tuning of the expiry thread per cache.

  * Added a new persistent option for the DiskStore. When enabled,
diskPersistent makes Caches persistent between JVM restarts. It enables
very long held caches to be configured, useful for very expensive
and/or long lived cache entries.

  * Improved code coverage. See clover coverage report.

  * New checkstyle rules, using checkstyle 3.4. Many additional
checks have been added and code cleanups done to make ehcache
more standards compliant and understandable than ever.


 See the release notes and full changelog {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=271146}here}}.

* 15 July 2004 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=250532}ehcache 0.9 released}}

 This is a large release. It fixes several bugs and adds many new features including:

  * ehcache.xml cache definitions can
now omit timeToIdle and/or timeToLive, which have been made optional
attributes.
    This will make cache config easier to read for eternal caches. Either
omitting the attributes or setting them to 0 causes them not to be
considered when calculating expiry. Earlier versions of ehcache
would
have immediately expired all elements if either attribute was set to 0,
so this change should not break any existing code.

  * Added getQuiet and putQuiet methods
to Cache. These methods are the same as get and put but do not affect
statistics.

  * Implemented an Element clone method.

  * Added calculateInMemorySize() method to Cache to measure the approximate size of a cache's memory footprint.

  * Added a new constructs package.

 Blocking, self populating and self populating collections cache
implementations are provided. They are useful where the cost of
creating a cache entry is high, and you want to make request threads
block until the first one creates the entry. While new to ehcache,
the package is based on code that has been in production for almost a year,
and is now ready for a wider audience.


 See the release notes and full changelog {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=250532}here}}.

* 15 May 2004 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=238512}ehcache 0.8 released}}.

 Changes include:

  * Fix to a rare null pointer exception.

  * Added {{{clover/index.html}Clover}}
test coverage. Many thanks to cortex for the free license. Note that
Clover is not included in the packaged binary code and no license is
required to use EHCache.
It is a development tool only.

  * Modifed some errors in the Apache license to enable its inclusion in the Apache Cocoon project.


* 2 Jan 2004 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=202390}ehcache 0.7 released}}.

 Bug fixes.

* 11 Dec 2003 EHCache is made the recommended process cache for {{{hibernate.org}Hibernate}} 2.1

* 8 Dec 2003 {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/shownotes.php?release_id=202390}ehcache 0.6 released}}.

 Bug fixes.

* 18 Nov 2003 {{{http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=329583}ehcache 0.5 released}}

 Now supports JDK1.2 and JDK1.3 as well as JKD1.4

* 13 Nov 2003 {{{http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=328369}ehcache 0.4 released}}.
