  using <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.

** 14 July: Ehcache-OpenJPA 0.1 released

  An Ehcache plugin for OpenJPA has been released. It can be easily plugged in to OpenJPA  to provide familiar ehcache
  caching. Conceptually the plugin is similar to Hibernate. Persistent Object caches and Query caches are implemented.

  Download {{{/download.html}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/openjpa_provider.html}here}}.

  The release is also available on Maven central.

  Thanks to Craig Andrews for contributing this plugin.


** 17 June 2009: Ehcache 1.6.0 released

  This production release of ehcache-1.6 adds bug fixes and massive performance improvements. This release contains
  the changes mooted in February.

  The changes removed most usages of the <<<synchronized>>> keyword from CacheManager, Cache and MemoryStore. The speed
  improvements kick in with significant numbers of threads which is what happens in production.
  Single-threaded performance, which is what you will see in your IDE is unchanged.

  The improvements are:

  * Gets 60 times faster

  * Puts 10 times faster

  * Removes 50 times faster


  This version removes all dependencies. Finally It is compatible with Google App Engine.

  For those still wishing to use the old engine it can be turned on at runtime
  using <<<java -Dnet.sf.ehcache.use.classic.lru=true>>>.

  Download {{{/download.html}here}}. All documentation is {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.
  The release is also available on Maven central.

  There are no open bugs at time of release.
  

** 10 May 2009: New Ehcache Maven repo

  The primary ehcache repo has been migrated, with all history to {{http://oss.sonatype.org}}. This change simplifies
  deployment and provides an advanced Maven Repository Manager to ehcache users. As usual all release artifacts are
  deployed to the central Maven repository.
  See {{{http://gregluck.com/blog/archives/2009/05/anyone_with_a_p.html}Greg Luck's blog}} for the full details.



** 11 April 2009: Ehcache Server and Ehcache Web updates released

    Ehcache Server, Standalone Server and Ehcache Web have been released to Maven Central and Sourceforge Downloads.

    Ehcache Server adds per PUT ttls to its REST API. The Standalone Server is upgraded to build 14 of Glassfish V3 Prelude
    Embedded which fixes all outstanding feature requests raised against it by this project. See the updated
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation/cache_server.html}documentation}}.

    Ehcache Web 1.6.0-beta2 contains a minor bug fix over beta1.

    This beta release of ehcache-1.6.0 adds bug fixes and dramatic performance improvements.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. All documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.

    A note on naming. With ehcache fully modularised, each module has its own release cycle which may or may not
    correspond with the Ehcache core releases.

** 28 January 2009: New releases which break JCache into its own module.

    A new release of Ehcache core, ehcache-1.6.0-beta3 and the new ehcache-jcache-1.1 break JCache functionality
    into its own Maven module and file download. jsr107cache has been updated to 1.1.

    The upshot of this change is that ehcache core has no third party dependencies, simplifying its use for many
    and making it easier to add ehcache to other projects.

    This completes the modularisation work for 1.6. The next beta will add bug fixes, performance improvements
    and some longstanding feature requests.

   Download {{{http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93232}here}}. All documentation is
    {{{http://ehcache.sourceforge.net/documentation}here}}.
