/**
 * A blocking decorator for an Ehcache, backed by a {@link Ehcache}.
 * <p/>
 * It allows concurrent read access to elements already in the cache. If the element is null, other
 * reads will block until an element with the same key is put into the cache.
 * <p/>
 * This is useful for constructing read-through or self-populating caches.
 * <p/>
 * This implementation uses the {@link Mutex} class from Doug Lea's concurrency package. If you wish to use
 * this class, you will need the concurrent package in your class path.
 * <p/>
 * It features:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Excellent liveness.
 * <li>Fine-grained locking on each element, rather than the cache as a whole.
 * <li>Scalability to a large number of threads.
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * This class has been updated to use Lock striping. The Mutex implementation gives scalability but creates
 * many Mutex objects of 24 bytes each. Lock striping limits their number to 100.
 * <p/>
 * A version of this class is planned which will dynamically use JDK5's concurrency package, which is
 * based on Doug Lea's, so as to avoid a dependency on his package for JDK5 systems. This will not
 * be implemented until JDK5 is released on MacOSX and Linux, as JDK5 will be required to compile
 * it, though any version from JDK1.2 up will be able to run the code, falling back to Doug
 * Lea's concurrency package, if the JDK5 package is not found in the classpath.
 * <p/>
 * The <code>Mutex</code> class does not appear in the JDK5 concurrency package. Doug Lea has
 * generously offered the following advice:
 * <p/>
 * "You should just be able to use ReentrantLock here.  We supply
 * ReentrantLock, but not Mutex because the number of cases where a
 * non-reentrant mutex is preferable is small, and most people are more
 * familiar with reentrant seamantics. If you really need a non-reentrant
 * one, the javadocs for class AbstractQueuedSynchronizer include sample
 * code for them."
 * <p/>
 * -Doug
 * <p/>
 * "Hashtable / synchronizedMap uses the "one big fat lock" approach to guard the mutable state of the map.
 * That works, but is a big concurrency bottleneck, as you've observed.  You went to the opposite extreme, one lock per key.
 * That works (as long as you've got sufficient synchronization in the cache itself to protect its own data structures.)
 * <p/>
 * Lock striping is a middle ground, partitioning keys into a fixed number of subsets, like the trick used at large
 * theaters for will-call ticket pickup -- there are separate lines for "A-F, G-M, N-R, and S-Z".
 * This way, there are a fixed number of locks, each guarding (hopefully) 1/Nth of the keys."
 * - Brian Goetz
 * <p/>
 * Further improvements to hashing suggested by Joe Bowbeer.
