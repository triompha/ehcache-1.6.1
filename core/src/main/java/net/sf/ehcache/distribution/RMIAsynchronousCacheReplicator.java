/**
 * Listens to {@link net.sf.ehcache.CacheManager} and {@link net.sf.ehcache.Cache} events and propagates those to
 * {@link CachePeer} peers of the Cache asynchronously.
 * <p/>
 * Updates are guaranteed to be replicated in the order in which they are received.
 * <p/>
 * While much faster in operation than {@link RMISynchronousCacheReplicator}, it does suffer from a number
 * of problems. Elements, which may be being spooled to DiskStore may stay around in memory because references
 * are being held to them from {@link EventMessage}s which are queued up. The replication thread runs once
 * per second, limiting the build up. However a lot of elements can be put into a cache in that time. We do not want
 * to get an {@link OutOfMemoryError} using distribution in circumstances when it would not happen if we were
 * just using the DiskStore.
 * <p/>
 * Accordingly, the Element values in {@link EventMessage}s are held by {@link java.lang.ref.SoftReference} in the queue,
 * so that they can be discarded if required by the GC to avoid an {@link OutOfMemoryError}. A log message
 * will be issued on each flush of the queue if there were any forced discards. One problem with GC collection
 * of SoftReferences is that the VM (JDK1.5 anyway) will do that rather than grow the heap size to the maximum.
 * The workaround is to either set minimum heap size to the maximum heap size to force heap allocation at start
 * up, or put up with a few lost messages while the heap grows.
