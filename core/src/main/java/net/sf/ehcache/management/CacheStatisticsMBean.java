     * This result is returned when the statistics accuracy setting is {@link net.sf.ehcache.Statistics#STATISTICS_ACCURACY_BEST_EFFORT}.

     * the number of {@link net.sf.ehcache.Element}s in the {@link net.sf.ehcache.store.DiskStore}.

     * This number is the actual number of elements, including expired elements that have
     * not been removed. Any duplicates between stores are accounted for.
     * <p/>
     * Expired elements are removed from the the memory store when
     * getting an expired element, or when attempting to spool an expired element to
     * disk.
     * <p/>
     * Expired elements are removed from the disk store when getting an expired element,
     * or when the expiry thread runs, which is once every five minutes.
     * <p/>
     * <h3>Guaranteed Accuracy Size</h3>
     * This result is returned when the statistics accuracy setting is {@link net.sf.ehcache.Statistics#STATISTICS_ACCURACY_GUARANTEED}.
     * <p/>
     * This method accounts for elements which might be expired or duplicated between stores. It take approximately
     * 200ms per 1000 elements to execute.

     * This result is returned when the statistics accuracy setting is {@link net.sf.ehcache.Statistics#STATISTICS_ACCURACY_NONE}.
     * <p/>
     * The number given may contain expired elements. In addition if the DiskStore is used it may contain some double
     * counting of elements. It takes 6ms for 1000 elements to execute. Time to execute is O(log n). 50,000 elements take
